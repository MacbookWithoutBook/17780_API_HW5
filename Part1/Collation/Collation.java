/**
 * The {@code Collation} class provides locale-specific string comparison and transformation capabilities.
 *
 * <p>This class includes methods for:
 * <ul>
 *     <li>Setting and retrieving the locale for specific {@link LocaleCategory} categories.</li>
 *     <li>Lexicographically comparing strings based on the collation rules of the current locale.</li>
 *     <li>Transforming a specified number of characters in a string according to locale-specific collation settings.</li>
 * </ul>
 * 
 * <p>Example Usage:</p>
 * <pre>{@code
 * Collation collation = new Collation();
 * boolean success = collation.setLocale(LocaleCategory.LC_ALL, "zh_CN.GB2312");
 * if (success) {
 *      System.out.println(collation.compareStringWithCollation("你好", "你好世界")); // expect a negative number
 *      System.out.println(collation.transformStringWithCollation("你好世界", 2)); // expect to be "你好"
 * }
